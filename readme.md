This is a very simple Duality Dice Roller for Daggerheart in Talespire

Just add your modifiers (if any, can be positive or negative),
and if it applies select Advantage/Disadvantage.

As soon as you click the "Roll Duality Dice" Button the roll gets added to the tray,
from which you can roll the dice like any other roll.

The result then gets shown in the chat with colored formatting.
